User should change the values of input variables Temp_rot and Temp_kin to the desired ones only in the file "Generate_Rates.f90".
For example, the current values in the main driver file are set to 250 and 300 K, respectively.
The unit of input temterature is K and the unit of output rate is cm^3/s.
