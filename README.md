<h1 align="center">H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O Collisional Rates Coefficients</h1>

## Objective:
This program computes rate coefficients for state-to-state rotational transitions in H2O + H2O system as a function of Rotational and Kinetic temperatures (T<sub>rot</sub> & T<sub>kin</sub>).

User should change the values of input variables Temp_rot and Temp_kin to the desired ones only in the file "Generate_Rates.f90".
For example, the current values in the main driver file are set to 250 and 300 K, respectively.
The unit of input temterature is K and the unit of output rate is cm^3/s.
